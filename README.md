# JavaScript Questions CLI

Takes questions from [lydiahallie/javascript-questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions) and starts a quizz in your terminal. You can stop whenever you want, your progress can be saved and resumed next time.

## Usage

```sh
npx javascript-questions-cli [lang]
```

### Supported languages:

- `en` (default)
- `ru`
- `vi`
- `bz`
- `de`
- `cz` should be supported as it's contributed in `lydiahallie`'s repository, but in current version there are issues parsing the Markdown for this language

Please note that not all languages have the same set of questions, the reference is `en`.
